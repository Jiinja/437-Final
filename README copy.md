The timestamped data contains the measured output load of the buildings (kWh) and thermal asset load(kBTU), in addition to associated weather conditions/holidays occuring during that same time period.
The goal is to use this historical data to predict both the electric load and thermal (cooling+heating) loads using this data through various methods.
